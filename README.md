napp.alloy.adapter.restsql
==========================

## Description

SQL & RestAPI Sync Adapter for Titanium Alloy Framework. 
The idea is to combine Restful API with a local sql database. 

## Status

**WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT COMPLETE.**


## How To Use

Simple add the following to your model in `PROJECT_FOLDER/app/models/`.

	exports.definition = {	
		"columns": { //example
			"id":"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT",
			"image":"text",
			"title":"text"
		},
		config: {
			"URL": "http://example.com/api/modelname",
			"adapter": {
				"type": "restsql",
				"collection_name": "mymodelname"
				"idAttribute": "id"
			}
		},		
		extendModel: function(Model) {		
			_.extend(Model.prototype, {});
			return Model;
		},	
		extendCollection: function(Collection) {		
			_.extend(Collection.prototype, {});
			return Collection;
		}		
	}

Then add the `restsql.js` to `PROJECT_FOLDER/assets/alloy/sync/`. Create the folders if they dont exist.
